# Community Contributions

This page highlights a selection of community-built contributions
created by developers within the Sharetribe community that extend what's
possible on the platform by default. They showcase the creativity,
skill, and initiative of our developer network, and provide resources
that others can use, learn from, or build upon.

Each project is independently developed and maintained by its author -
Sharetribe does not own or maintain these contributions.

own?
