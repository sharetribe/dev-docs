# What development skills are needed with the Sharetribe Web Template?

You can use any technology to build a marketplace on top of the
[Marketplace API](/introduction/#the-marketplace-api). However, making a
marketplace user interface (UI) from scratch requires a lot of effort.
This is why we provide the Sharetribe Web Template. It is a polished
marketplace web application that is ready for customization.

The Sharetribe Web Template is a template web application that uses the
Marketplace API. It is built using common and modern frontend tooling,
so frontend developers should feel right at home and happy with all the
technology.

## Technologies

Here are the main technologies the Sharetribe Web Template uses:

- JavaScript: the programming language for the whole application
- CSS: styling the user interface using
  [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/): library for creating user interfaces
  with components
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/): state and data flow handling
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main): routing
- [Final Form](https://github.com/final-form/final-form): forms
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/): server side rendering of the React
  application
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): development tooling and running the
  Express server

## Customization

In addition to the technologies used in the template, customizing the
template with code will likely require skills with the following tools:

- Working with the
  [Sharetribe APIs](/concepts/api-sdk/marketplace-api-integration-api/)
  and the [corresponding SDKs](/concepts/api-sdk/js-sdk/)
- Command line tools like the
  [Sharetribe CLI](/introduction/getting-started-with-sharetribe-cli/)
- [The EDN notation format](/concepts/development/edn/) for modifying
  transaction processes and migration files

## Development tooling

While the Sharetribe Web Template uses Webpack, PostCSS, and various
other tools behind the scene, knowledge of these technologies is not
needed in usual customizations. Compared to a usual frontend project
with a long list of dependencies and extensive Webpack configuration
files, Sharetribe Web Template hides all this behind a
[sharetribe-scripts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sharetribe-scripts)
NPM package.

`sharetribe-scripts` is a fork of the `react-scripts` package in the
amazing [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
tool. We have added server side rendering and CSS modules, but otherwise
all the nice things from `create-react-app` are still there.
