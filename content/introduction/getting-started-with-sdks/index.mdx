# Getting started with the JavaScript SDKs

Sharetribe's
[JavaScript Software Development Kit](https://sharetribe.github.io/flex-sdk-js/)
(SDK) and
[Integration SDK](https://sharetribe.github.io/flex-integration-sdk-js/)
simplify interactions with our APIs. You can read more about features
and functionalities in our
[SDK GitHub Documentation](https://sharetribe.GitHub.io/flex-sdk-js/index.html).
This guide covers

- Installation
- Initialization and instantiating the SDK
- Creating a trusted SDK instance
- Example use cases

## Overview

Our SDKs simplify making requests to the backend by handling
authentication and providing convenient access to Sharetribe's APIs.
They allow you to interact easily with

- [Marketplace API](https://www.sharetribe.com/api-reference/marketplace.html),
  for general interactions with marketplace data
- [Integration API](https://www.sharetribe.com/api-reference/integration.html),
  for advanced operational use
- [Asset Delivery API](https://www.sharetribe.com/api-reference/asset-delivery-api.html),
  for delivering assets configured in Console

You can find more information on API usage and guidelines for choosing
which to work with in
[this article](https://www.sharetribe.com/docs/concepts/api-sdk/marketplace-api-integration-api/#when-to-use-the-marketplace-api).

There are two JavaScript SDKs you can use to access the APIs

To try out the SDKs, visit our
[Github documentation for the Sharetribe SDK](https://sharetribe.GitHub.io/flex-sdk-js/index.html)
and the
[Integration SDK](https://sharetribe.github.io/flex-integration-sdk-js/)
for instructions on how to get started. For a more detailed guide on
using the SDKs with code, keep following this tutorial.

<Callout type="info">
  Certain requests will require a secure context. An easy way to do this
  is to run a small server from which to make these types of requests.
</Callout>

## Installation

To get started with the SDKs, you'll first need to install them with
either [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Tabs items={['yarn', 'npm']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  ```shell 
  yarn add sharetribe-flex-sdk
  ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  ```shell 
npm install sharetribe-flex-sdk
  ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>
{/* // prettier-ignore */}

## SDK Initialization Overview

### Obtaining the Client ID and secret

To use the Marketplace API or Integration API, you will need a **client
ID** from an application. You can create an application in Sharetribe
Console: _Build > Advanced > Applications_

![Sharetribe Console: Applications tab](./console-build-application.png)

You should also make note of the **client secret**, as some requests
require a secure context and this can only be done when initializing the
SDK with both the client ID and secret.

An example of this type of request is making a privileged transition in
a transaction. This requires that the:

- Client ID and secret are used when creating an instance of the SDK
- A token exchange happens to obtain a trusted user access token
- The request is made from a secure context.

<Callout type="info">
  In the [Sharetribe Web
  Template](https://github.com/sharetribe/web-template), these types of
  requests are made on a small Node server included in the Template.
</Callout>

### Initializing a Sharetribe SDK instance

You can initialize a Sharetribe SDK instance using only the
application's Client ID. Ensure the client ID is from a **Marketplace
API application** created in Console.

```jsx
const sharetribeSdk = require('sharetribe-flex-sdk');

const sdk = sharetribeSdk.createInstance({
  clientId: '<Client ID>',
});
```

This will allow you to make requests that don't require authentication
or a trusted SDK instance, e.g. querying listings.

### Initializing an Integration SDK instance

If you are accessing Integration API, you'll need to also provide the
client secret. Ensure the client ID is from an **Integration API
application** created in Console.

```jsx
const sharetribeIntegrationSdk = require('sharetribe-flex-integration-sdk');

const integrationSdk = sharetribeIntegrationSdk.createInstance({
  clientId: '<Client ID>',
  clientSecret: '<Client secret>',
});
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Keep your application's client secret secure. Never expose it to
  untrusted devices or applications such as end user browsers or mobile
  apps.
</Callout>

### Initializing the SDK with a trusted user access token

To make certain requests, you will need to access the Marketplace API
from a trusted context. In order to do this, you'll need to log in using
the SDK and perform a token exchange to retrieve a trusted token.

<Steps>

{<h3>Create an instance of the SDK with the client ID, secret, and token
store</h3>}

```jsx
// use 'sharetribe-flex-integration-sdk' here to create and integration SDK instance
const sharetribeSdk = require('sharetribe-flex-sdk');

var sdk = sharetribeSdk.createInstance({
  clientId: '<Client ID>',
  clientSecret: '<Client secret>',
  tokenStore: sharetribeSdk.tokenStore.memoryStore(),
});
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Keep your application's client secret secure. Never expose it to
  untrusted devices or applications such as end user browsers or mobile
  apps.
</Callout>

{<h3>Log in using valid credentials</h3>}

```jsx
sdk.login({ username: '<User email>', password: '<User password>' });
```

{<h3>Exchange the access token for a trusted token and create a new
instance of the SDK</h3>}

```jsx
sdk.exchangeToken().then((res) => {
  const sdkTrusted = sharetribeSdk.createInstance({
    clientId: '<Client ID>',
    tokenStore: sharetribeSdk.tokenStore.memoryStore(res.data),
  });
});
```

</Steps>

Now you can use `sdkTrusted` to make requests that rely on a secure
context, e.g. deleting a user with
[Marketplace API](https://www.sharetribe.com/api-reference/marketplace.html#delete-user).

<Callout type="info">
  Requests that require a trusted SDK instance rely on valid login
  credentials appropriate for the request. For example, to delete a user
  you must log in with that user's credentials.
</Callout>

## Example usage

Here are a few examples demonstrating common uses and capabilities of
the SDKs.

### Logging in

**API**: Marketplace API

Some endpoints require that a user is logged in first, e.g. creating
listings, viewing their own listings, or initiating inquiry
transactions.

```jsx
const sharetribeSdk = require('sharetribe-flex-sdk');

var sdk = sharetribeSdk.createInstance({
  clientId: '<Client ID>',
});

sdk
  .login({ username: '<User email>', password: '<User password>' })
  .then((_) => {
    // Request dependent on an authenticated user access token
  });
```

### Initiating a transaction

**API**: Marketplace API

The process of initiating a transaction is highly variable because it
depends entirely on transaction flow customizations and the required
parameters of the transition.

For this example, we'll use the default-booking process, and choose
`transition/request-payment` as the first step. This requires that:

- The customer is logged in
- A token exchange is made to get a trusted user access token
- The request includes the following parameters
  - `transition`
  - `processAlias`
  - `params`
    - `listingID`
    - `bookingStart`
    - `bookingEnd`
    - `lineItems`

<Callout type="info">
  This example uses the **minimum** required parameters per the
  transition defined in the transaction process. You'll likely want to
  include more information during this step, e.g. updating the
  transaction's extended data. See the [Marketplace API reference
  documentation](https://www.sharetribe.com/api-reference/marketplace.html#initiate-transaction)
  for more information.
</Callout>

```jsx
const sharetribeSdk = require('sharetribe-flex-sdk');

const transition = 'transition/request-payment';
const processAlias = 'default-booking/release-1';

const params = {
  listingId: '<Listing ID>',
  bookingStart: '2025-12-20T22:00:00.000Z',
  bookingEnd: '2025-12-21T22:00:00.000Z',
  lineItems: [
    {
      code: 'line-item/night',
      unitPrice: {
        _sdkType: 'Money',
        amount: 5000,
        currency: 'EUR',
      },
      quantity: 1,
      includeFor: ['customer', 'provider'],
    },
    {
      code: 'line-item/provider-commission',
      unitPrice: {
        _sdkType: 'Money',
        amount: 5000,
        currency: 'EUR',
      },
      percentage: -13,
      includeFor: ['provider'],
    },
  ],
};

const sdk = sharetribeSdk.createInstance({
  clientId: '<Client ID>',
  clientSecret: '<Client secret>',
});

sdk
  .login({ username: '<User email>', password: '<User password>' })
  .then((_) => {
    sdk.exchangeToken().then((res) => {
      var store = sharetribeSdk.tokenStore.memoryStore();
      store.setToken(res.data);

      var sdkTrusted = sharetribeSdk.createInstance({
        clientId: '<Client ID>',
        tokenStore: store,
      });

      // It's useful to first call initiateSpeculative to validate the data and to ensure
      // the real request will complete as expected
      sdkTrusted.transactions
        .initiateSpeculative(
          {
            transition,
            processAlias,
            params,
          },
          {
            expand: true,
          }
        )
        .then((speculatedResult) => {
          if (speculatedResult.status == 200) {
            sdkTrusted.transactions
              .initiate({
                transition,
                processAlias,
                params,
              })
              .then((initiateResult) => {
                // initiateResult.data
              });
          }
        });
    });
  });
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Keep your application's client secret secure. Never expose it to
  untrusted devices or applications such as end user browsers or mobile
  apps.
</Callout>

### Transitioning a transaction

**API**: Marketplace API

This example shows how you can transition a transaction that has already
been initiated. The logged-in user must be a party that is allowed to
perform the transition - either the customer or provider. This can be
checked in the transaction process visualizer in Console, or from the
transaction's `process.edn` file.

<Callout type="info">
  Not all transitions require a trusted context. For non-privileged
  transitions, simply [logging
  in](https://www.sharetribe.com/docs/introduction/getting-started-with-sdks/#logging-in)
  is sufficient. For privileged transitions however, you'll need to use
  a trusted SDK instance. You can read more about privileged transitions
  [here](https://www.sharetribe.com/docs/concepts/transactions/privileged-transitions/).
</Callout>

```jsx
const sharetribeSdk = require('sharetribe-flex-sdk');

var sdk = sharetribeSdk.createInstance({
  clientId: '<Client ID>',
  clientSecret: '<Client secret>',
  tokenStore: sharetribeSdk.tokenStore.memoryStore(),
});

sdk
  .login({ username: '<User email>', password: '<User password>' })
  .then((_) => {
    sdk.exchangeToken().then((res) => {
      var store = sharetribeSdk.tokenStore.memoryStore();
      store.setToken(res.data);

      var sdkTrusted = sharetribeSdk.createInstance({
        clientId: '<Client ID>',
        tokenStore: store,
      });

      sdkTrusted.transactions
        .transition({
          id: '<Transaction ID>',
          transition: '<Transition name>',
          params: {},
        })
        .then((res) => {
          // res.data
        });
    });
  });
```

### Updating metadata in a transaction

**API**: Integration API

Updating metadata for a transaction requires that you use the
Integration API.

```jsx
const integrationSdk = require('sharetribe-flex-integration-sdk');

var sdk = integrationSdk.createInstance({
  clientId: '<Client ID>',
  clientSecret: '<Client secret>',
});

sdk.transactions
  .updateMetadata({
    id: '<Transaction ID>',
    metadata: {
      '<Key>': '<Value>',
    },
  })
  .then((res) => {
    // res.data
  });
```

### Updating a listing

**API**: Marketplace API

Updating a listing requires that the listing author's credentials are
used.

```jsx
const sharetribeSdk = require('sharetribe-flex-sdk');

var sdk = sharetribeSdk.createInstance({
  clientId: '<Client ID>',
});

sdk
  .login({ username: '<User email>', password: '<User password>' })
  .then((_) => {
    sdk.ownListings
      .update({
        id: '<Listing ID>',
        description: '<Updated description>',
        privateData: {
          '<Key>': '<Value>',
        },
        publicData: {
          '<Key>': '<Value>',
        },
      })
      .then((res) => {
        // res.data
      });
  });
```

### Retrieving listing assets defined in Console

**API**: Asset delivery API

This example will show how to retrieve all listing-related
configurations as defined in Console.

- Types
- Categories
- Fields
- Search

```jsx
const sharetribeSdk = require('sharetribe-flex-sdk');

var sdk = sharetribeSdk.createInstance({
  clientId: '<Client ID>',
});

sdk
  .assetsByAlias({
    paths: [
      '/listings/listing-types.json',
      '/listings/listing-categories.json',
      '/listings/listing-fields.json',
      '/listings/listing-search.json',
    ],
    alias: 'latest',
  })
  .then((res) => {
    // res.data
  });
```
