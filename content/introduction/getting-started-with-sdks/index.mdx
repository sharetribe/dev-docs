# Getting started with the JavaScript SDK

Sharetribe's JavaScript Software Development Kit (SDK) and Integration
SDK simplify interactions with our APIs. You can read more about
features and functionalities in our
[SDK GitHub Documentation](https://sharetribe.GitHub.io/flex-sdk-js/index.html).
This guide covers

- Installation
- Initialization and instantiating the SDK
- Creating a trusted SDK instance
- Example use cases

## Overview

Our SDKs simplify making requests to the backend by handling
authentication and providing convenient access to Sharetribe's APIs.
They allow you to interact easily with

- Marketplace API, for general interactions with marketplace data
- Asset Delivery API, for delivering assets configured in Console
- Integration API, for advanced operational use

You can find more information on API usage and guidelines for choosing
which to work with in
[this article](https://www.sharetribe.com/docs/concepts/api-sdk/marketplace-api-integration-api/#when-to-use-the-marketplace-api).

There are two SDK variants in which to access the APIs

To try out the Sharetribe SDK, visit our
[Github documentation](https://sharetribe.GitHub.io/flex-sdk-js/index.html)
for instructions on testing it directly in your browser or via the
[API Playground](https://sharetribe.GitHub.io/flex-sdk-js/try-it-in-the-playground.html).
For a more detailed guide on using the SDK with code, keep following
this tutorial.

## Installation

To get started with the SDK, you'll first need to install it with either
[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

```jsx
yarn add sharetribe-flex-sdk
```

or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

```jsx
npm install sharetribe-flex-sdk
```

<Callout type="info">
  The above example will create an instance that allows you to access
  Marketplace API and Asset Delivery API. In order to access Integration
  API, run `yarn add sharetribe-flex-integration-sdk`
</Callout>

## SDK Initialization Overview

### API applications

To use the Marketplace API or Integration API, you will need a **client
ID**.

When you get access, you will be able to log into Sharetribe Console and
check the client ID.<br /> Sharetribe Console: _Build > Advanced >
Applications_

In addition, Sharetribe Web Template uses transaction processes that
include privileged transitions. This makes it possible to customize
pricing on the Node server that's included in the template. The **client
secret** is needed to make this secure call from the template's own
server to Sharetribe API.

### Initializing a basic SDK instance

You can initialize a basic SDK instance using only the application's
Client ID. Ensure the client ID is from a **Marketplace API
application** created in Console.

```jsx
const sharetribeSdk = require('sharetribe-flex-sdk');

const sdk = sharetribeSdk.createInstance({
  clientId: '<Client ID>',
});
```

This will allow you to make requests that don't require authentication
or a trusted SDK instance, e.g. querying listings.

### Initializing an Integration SDK instance

If you are accessing Integration API, you'll need to also provide the
client secret. Ensure the client ID is from an **Integration API
application** created in Console.

```jsx
const sharetribeIntegrationSdk = require('sharetribe-flex-integration-sdk');

const integrationSdk = sharetribeIntegrationSdk.createInstance({
  clientId: '<Client ID>',
  clientSecret: '<Client secret>',
});
```

### Initializing a trusted SDK instance

To make certain requests, you will need to access the APIs from a
trusted context. In order to do this, you'll need to log in using the
SDK and perform a token exchange to retrieve a trusted token.

1. Create an instance of the SDK with the client ID, secret, and token
   store

```jsx
// use 'sharetribe-flex-integration-sdk' here to create and integration SDK instance
const sharetribeSdk = require('sharetribe-flex-sdk');

var sdk = sharetribeSdk.createInstance({
  clientId: '<Client ID>',
  clientSecret: '<Client secret>',
  tokenStore: sharetribeSdk.tokenStore.memoryStore(),
});
```

2. Log in using valid credentials

```jsx
sdk.login({ username: '<User email>', password: '<User password>' });
```

3. Exchange the access token for a trusted token

```jsx
sdk.exchangeToken().then((res) => {
  var store = sharetribeSdk.tokenStore.memoryStore();
  store.setToken(res.data);
});
```

4. Create an instance of the SDK using the trusted token

```jsx
var sdkTrusted = sharetribeSdk.createInstance({
  clientId: '<Client ID>',
  tokenStore: sharetribeSdk.tokenStore.memoryStore(),
});
```

Now you can use `sdkTrusted` to make requests that rely on a secure
context, e.g. deleting a user with
[Marketplace API](https://www.sharetribe.com/api-reference/marketplace.html#delete-user).

<Callout type="info">
  Requests that require a trusted SDK rely on valid login credentials
  appropriate for the request. For example, to delete a user you must
  log in with that user's credentials.
</Callout>

## Example usage

Here are a few examples demonstrating common uses and capabilities of
the SDKs.

### Logging in

```jsx
const sharetribeSdk = require('sharetribe-flex-sdk');

var sdk = sharetribeSdk.createInstance({
  clientId: '<Client ID>',
});

sdk
  .login({ username: '<User email>', password: '<User password>' })
  .then((_) => {
    // Request dependent on a trusted access token
  });
```

### Initializing a trusted SDK

```jsx
const sharetribeSdk = require('sharetribe-flex-sdk');

var sdk = sharetribeSdk.createInstance({
  clientId: '<Client ID>',
  clientSecret: '<Client secret>',
  tokenStore: sharetribeSdk.tokenStore.memoryStore(),
});

sdk
  .login({ username: '<User email>', password: '<User password>' })
  .then((_) => {
    sdk.exchangeToken().then((res) => {
      var store = sharetribeSdk.tokenStore.memoryStore();
      store.setToken(res.data);

      var sdkTrusted = sharetribeSdk.createInstance({
        clientId: '<Client ID>',
        tokenStore: store,
      });

      // Place the request requiring trusted access here
    });
  });
```

### Updating a listing

```jsx
const sharetribeSdk = require('sharetribe-flex-sdk');

var sdk = sharetribeSdk.createInstance({
  clientId: '<Client ID>',
});

sdk
  .login({ username: '<User email>', password: '<User password>' })
  .then((_) => {
    sdk.ownListings
      .update({
        id: '<Listing ID>',
      })
      .then((res) => {
        // res.data
      });
  });
```

<Callout>
  Updating a listing requires that the listing author's credentials are
  provided in the log in step
</Callout>

### Updating metadata in a transactions

```jsx
const IntegrationSdk = require('sharetribe-flex-integration-sdk');

var sdk = sharetribeSdk.createInstance({
  clientId: '<Client ID>',
  clientSecret: '<Client secret>',
});

sdk.transactions
  .updateMetadata({
    id: '<Transaction ID>',
    metadata: {
      '<Key>': '<Value>',
    },
  })
  .then((res) => {
    // res.data
  });
```
