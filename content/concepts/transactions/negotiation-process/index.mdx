# Negotiation process

Sharetribe has a _default-negotiation_ transaction process that includes
price negotiation dynamics. The same process enables both regular and
reverse transaction flows.

## **Regular transaction flow**

A regular transaction flow refers to a traditional marketplace
transaction flow. This happens on a marketplace when the provider posts
a listing and a customer can initiate a transaction against that
listing.

A transaction process supports the regular flow when it has one or more
initial transitions defined for the customer. When a transaction is
initiated using a customer transition, it follows a regular transaction
flow.

The _default-negotiation_ process has one initial transition defined for
a customer:

```clj
  {:name :transition/request-quote,
   :to :state/quote-requested,
   :actor :actor.role/customer,
   :actions [{:name :action/update-protected-data}]}
```

## **Reverse transaction flow**

A reverse transaction flow on a marketplace happens when the customer
posts a listing and a provider can initiate a transaction against that
listing. This means that the initiating transition for the transaction
is made by the provider.

A transaction process supports the reverse flow when it has one or more
initial transitions defined for the provider. When a transaction is
initiated using a provider transition, it follows a reverse transaction
flow.

The _default-negotiation_ process has two initial transitions defined
for a provider: _transition/make-offer_ and _transition/inquire_:

```clj
  {:name :transition/make-offer,
   :to :state/offer-pending,
   :actor :actor.role/provider,
   :actions
   [{:name :action/privileged-set-line-items}
    {:name :action/update-protected-data}
    {:name :action/privileged-update-metadata}],
   :privileged? true}
  {:name :transition/inquire,
   :to :state/inquiry,
   :actor :actor.role/provider,
   :actions []}
```

<Callout>

Sharetribe Console supports creating listing types with the reverse
negotiation flow starting in October 2025. The Sharetribe Web Template
supports starting and processing transactions with those listing types
starting with version
[9.0.0](https://github.com/sharetribe/web-template/releases/tag/v9.0.0).

Adding the regular transaction negotiation flow to listing types, or
processing transactions with the regular negotiation process flow, is
not supported in the template or Console as of October 2025.
Implementing support for this part of the negotiation process in your
client application will require custom development.

</Callout>

In both regular and reverse flows, the provider provides the product or
service in question, and the customer pays for the transaction.

<details>
  <summary>No bookings or stock by default</summary>

The _default-negotiation_ process does not include bookings or stock.
You can customize the process to include availability handling or stock
handling in addition to price negotiation. For bookings, we also offer
an example transaction process
[negotiated-booking](https://github.com/sharetribe/example-processes/blob/master/README.md#negotiated-booking)
â€“ it is not supported by default in the Sharetribe Web Template, so you
will need to build a client-side implementation.

</details>

The default negotiation process is best suited for use cases where the
customer and provider negotiate both the scope and the price of the
transaction, such as a custom built item or a complex project.

The negotiation process has four main phases:

1. Transaction initiation
2. Negotiation loop
3. Change request loop
4. Reviews

![Full negotiation process](./negotiation-full-process-highlight-phases.png)

In addition to transitions that process in a linear manner, it is also
possible to build loops in a transaction process. A loop in a
transaction process means that the same state may be entered multiple
times. Loops make it possible for the participants to go back and forth
in the process, or for either participant to take the same action
multiple times.

The default-negotiation process has two main loops: the
[negotiation loop](#negotiation-loop) and the
[change request loop](#change-request-loop).

In addition, the negotiation loop contains a sub-loop where a provider
can update their offer multiple times before the customer has accepted
it.

<Callout>

With all transaction process loops, including the ones in this process,
it is important to keep in mind that a single transaction can only have
a maximum of 100 transitions. This means that any implementation you
create must make sure that you restrict looping transitions after a
certain threshold, because your users should always have enough
transition quota left to finish the transaction.

The Sharetribe Web Template default implementation for the reverse
negotiation flow takes this limitation into account. It
[disables the customer's counter offer button after 50 transitions](https://github.com/sharetribe/web-template/blob/main/src/containers/TransactionPage/TransactionPage.stateDataNegotiation.js#L86-L117),
and from
[requesting changes to the order after 90 transitions](https://github.com/sharetribe/web-template/blob/main/src/containers/TransactionPage/TransactionPage.stateDataNegotiation.js#L183-L218).

</Callout>

## Transaction initiation

First, either the customer or the provider initiates the transaction.
Transaction initiation does not have looping logic.

In a regular flow, a customer can start the transaction against the
provider's listing by requesting a quote. The provider can then submit
an offer from the request, and submitting an offer
[adds line items](/references/transaction-process-actions/#actionprivileged-set-line-items)
to the transaction. Alternatively, the provider (or operator) can reject
the quote request. The customer can also withdraw their own quote
request.

![Customer requests a quote](./request-quote-details.png)

<Callout>

In the transaction process graphs in this article and in Console, orange
arrows show transitions defined for the customer, and purple arrows show
transitions defined for the provider. Green arrows show transitions
defined for the operator, and grey arrows show automatic transitions.

</Callout>

In a reverse flow, a provider can start the transaction against the
customer's listing in two ways:

- the provider can inquire, which does not add line items to the
  transaction
- or the provider can submit an offer, which does add line items to the
  transaction.

![Provider submits offer](./make-offer-details.png)

## Negotiation loop

After the transaction has been initiated and the provider has submitted
an offer, both regular and reverse transactions proceed in the same way.
The negotiation phase loops between two states:

- _state/offer-pending_
- _state/customer-offer-pending_

![Negotiation loop states](./customer-provider-offers-transitions-highlight-states.png)

From _state/offer-pending_, there are multiple paths for both the
customer and the provider.

<Callout>

Even though technically the parties can use the looping transitions to
negotiate the price, in practice we recommend that the participants
exchange messages to land on the quote and other offer details. That
way, they don't use up the allowed transaction quota during the
negotiation phase.

</Callout>

When there is a pending offer from the provider (_state/offer-pending_),
the customer can continue the transaction in two ways: either

- accept the offer and make a payment, which exits the negotiation loop
- or make a counter-offer and suggest new line items for the
  transaction.

The customer or operator can also end the transaction by rejecting the
offer from _state/offer-pending_.

![Customer options from state/offer-pending](./customer-provider-offers-transitions-highlight-customer-path.png)

The provider can withdraw or update their offer from
_state/offer-pending_. If the provider updates their offer, the
transaction goes to _state/update-pending_. From this state, the
provider can re-update their offer or withdraw it.

![Provider transitions around update offer](./update-offer-transitions-highlight-provider-path.png)

The customer can either accept the update or reject the new offer from
_state/update-pending_. The operator can also accept an update to the
offer. Accepting the offer transitions the transaction back to
_state/offer-pending_ and the main negotiation loop.

![Customer transitions around update offer](./update-offer-transitions-highlight-customer-path.png)

If a customer makes a counter offer from _state/offer-pending_ and moves
the transaction to _state/customer-offer-pending_, the provider can
continue the transaction in three ways, all of which transition the
transaction back to _state/offer-pending_:

- they can make a new counter offer
- they can accept the customer's counter offer
- or they can reject the customer's counter offer

![Provider paths from customer counter offer](./customer-provider-offers-transitions-highlight-provider-paths-from-customer-offer.png)

The customer can withdraw their counter offer, which also transitions
the transaction back to _state/offer-pending_. The only way to end the
transaction from _state/customer-offer-pending_ is the operator
transition _operator-reject-from-customer-counter-offer_

![Customer paths from customer counter offer](./customer-provider-offers-transitions-highlight-customer-path-from-customer-offer.png)

When the customer and provider are both happy with the offer, the
customer can initiate payment with the current quote, i.e. the line
items set for the transaction. Once the payment has been confirmed, the
transaction moves to the second main loop, which is the change request
loop.

## Change request loop

After the payment step, the transaction now moves on into the delivery
and change request phase.

![Change request loop](./change-request-loop-full.png)

When the provider delivers the order, or the operator marks the order as
delivered, the transaction transitions to _state/delivered_.

The transaction can now loop between two states:

- _state/delivered_
- _state/changes-requested_

![Change request loop](./change-request-loop-highlight-states.png)

The customer and operator can now

- accept the order, and transition the transaction to _state/completed_
- or they can request changes by transitioning the transaction to
  _state/changes-requested_

![Customer paths in change request loop](./change-request-loop-highlight-customer-paths.png)

The details of the change request will need to be discussed in messages,
since the change request transition does not have any actions to store
the change request information.

Once changes have been requested, the provider has only one transition
available â€“ to deliver the changes and transition the transaction back
to _state/delivered_.

![Provider path in change request loop](./change-request-loop-highlight-provider-path.png)

In addition, there are multiple operator transitions and automatic
transitions at play.

- If the provider doesn't deliver the order in 75 days from the payment,
  the transaction is automatically canceled with _auto-cancel_. The
  operator can also manually cancel the transaction before the order is
  delivered with _operator-cancel_. This ends the transaction.
- Once the order has been marked as delivered, the operator can cancel
  the transition with _operator-cancel-from-delivered_.
- Once a customer has requested changes, the operator can cancel the
  transaction with _operator-cancel-from-changes-requested_. If the
  change request is still pending in 75 days from the payment, the
  transaction is automatically canceled with
  _auto-cancel-from-changes-requested_.

All of these paths transition the transaction to _state/canceled_

![Operator and automatic transitions in change request loop](./change-request-loop-highlight-operator-transitions.png)

If the customer doesn't request changes, and the transaction has
remained in _state/delivered_ for 14 days, the transaction automatically
transitions to _state/completed_.

## Reviews

After the transaction is in _state/completed_, the participants can then
review each other similarly to other transaction processes. The review
phase does not have looping logic.

![Review transitions](./review-transitions.png)

Both parties are invited to post a review once the transaction
completes. Whoever posts their review first, the other participant is
notified that they still need to post their review. Reviews are only
published once both parties have posted their review, or once the review
period expires and the participants can no longer submit a review.
