## Testing extrainfo tags

<details>
  <summary>Can I use X with Sharetribe?</summary>
The answer is "yes" for most things. Since Nextra is just a Next.js plugin, almost all the things
that can be done with React can be done with Nextra. Here are some examples and guides:

- [Use Tailwind CSS](/docs/guide/tailwind-css)
- [Use custom CSS and Sass](/docs/guide/custom-css)
- [Use custom fonts](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization)
