# How to change marketplace language

If you want the template to use a language that is not supported by
default, the easiest way to do this is through Console. See our
[Help Center article](https://www.sharetribe.com/help/en/articles/8418391-supported-languages-and-locales#h_4d99ff50aa)
on how to do this.

However, if you would still like to do this programmatically, there are
some steps you need to follow. This article will walk you through those.

## Remove marketplace texts in Console

In Console, navigate to Console > Build > Content > Marketplace texts.
From here, you'll need to remove everything between the brackets in the
editor, so that it just contains `{}`. Remember to save your progress!

## Creating a new marketplace text file

1. Copy the default `src/translations/en.json` English marketplace text
   file into some other file, for example `it.json` for Italian.

2. Change the messages in the new marketplace text file to the
   translations of the desired language.

We have a few other language files available in
[src/translations/](https://github.com/sharetribe/web-template/tree/master/src/translations)
directory for you to start customizing marketplace texts.

</Callout>

Even if you use
[hosted marketplace texts](/template/content-management/hosted-marketplace-texts/)
to manage your marketplace texts, it is still important to have a
built-in language-specific marketplace text file in the template as
well, so that the application can show meaningful messages for any keys
missing from the Sharetribe Console marketplace text asset.

## Changing the marketplace texts used in the template

Once you have the marketplace text file in place:

1. Comment out, or remove, the `messagesInLocale` definition in the
   [Template file src/app.js](https://github.com/sharetribe/web-template/blob/e014ddc6834a2cf1c46a514458f26656c3ce9882/src/app.js#L71).

2. Point `messagesInLocale` to correct `.json` file, for example:

```js filename="src/app.js"
import messagesInLocale from './translations/fr.json';`
```

3. If you are using a locale not currently supported in Console while
   working with moment library, you can either:
   - Add you preferred locale to
     [MomentLocaleLoader](https://github.com/sharetribe/web-template/blob/e014ddc6834a2cf1c46a514458f26656c3ce9882/src/app.js#L107)
   - Stop using the
     [MomentLocaleLoader](https://github.com/sharetribe/web-template/blob/e014ddc6834a2cf1c46a514458f26656c3ce9882/src/app.js#L107)
     and instead import the locale directly in `app.js, e.g.

   ```js filename="src/app.js"
   import 'moment/locale/fr';
   const hardCodedLocale =
     process.env.NODE_ENV === 'test' ? 'en' : 'fr';
   ```

<Callout type="info">
  Sharetribe supports a wide range of locales out of the box. Check
  Console to see if your chosen locale is already supported by
  navigating to Build > General > Localizations > Locale.
</Callout>

4.  Point `messagesInLocale` to correct .json file, for example:

```js
import messagesInLocale from './translations/it.json';
```

It is also recommended to change _en.json_ translations. That way,
accidentally deleted keys in dynamic hosted marketplace texts (in
Console) won't cause the default English translations to be rendered in
your custom client app.

## Changing the marketplace texts used in tests

Also, in case you will translate the application and develop it forward
it is wise to change the marketplace text file that the tests use.
Normally tests are language agnostic as they use marketplace text keys
as values. However, when adding new marketplace texts you can end up
with missing marketplace text keys in tests. To change the marketplace
text file used in tests change the `messages` variable in
[src/util/test-helpers.js](https://github.com/sharetribe/web-template/blob/master/src/util/test-helpers.js)
to match your language in use, for example:

```js
import messages from '../translations/it.json';
```

## Developing the Sharetribe Web Template into a multilanguage marketplace

If you intend to modify the template to handle multiple languages, it is
good to note that the template is by default configured to run in single
language mode, so a multilanguage marketplace requires custom
development. For multiple languages, you basically have two approaches
for that custom development.

The first option is to create two versions of the client app, one for
Language 1 and one for Language 2. They can both point to the same
Marketplace API i.e. share the same listings, users, transaction
processes etc. If you have a very location-specific marketplace with
different locations mainly in different languages, this might be a good
approach, because you can then target your UI, branding and localization
more closely to the target area.

Another option is to customize a single client app to provide multiple
languages. For instance, you could import several language files in
`src/app.js` and select which one you are going to use by modifying
`src/routeConfiguration.js`, so that all the paths include a ”locale”
variable. E.g. `/about` could be changed to `/:locale/about` to capture
paths like `/fr/about`. In this case, it is useful to save the user's
language preference to the extended data.
