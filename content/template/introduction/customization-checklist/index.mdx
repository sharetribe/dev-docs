# Customization checklist

The Sharetribe Web Template provides a great starting point for
developing your marketplace. This article provides a reference list of
articles and guides you can use when you start customising your
marketplace's visual appearance, content and configurations.

## Visual appearance

You can edit the default styles of the template via the branding tab in
Console. For more advanced changes you can:

- [Learn to style the template using CSS](/tutorial/first-edit/)
- Learn more about the
  [CSS architecture in the Sharetribe Web Template](/template/styling/how-to-customize-template-styles/)

## Configuration

The configuration file of your marketplace template is a valuable
resource that allows you to easily adjust a wide range of options in
your marketplace. Configuration files can be found in the
[src/config directory](https://github.com/sharetribe/web-template/tree/main/src/config).
Before you begin modifying the configuration files, it is important to
ensure that you have properly configured any environment variables that
your marketplace uses. These variables are typically used to store
sensitive information such as API keys, and must be set up correctly in
order for your marketplace to function properly.

- Configure your
  [environment variables](/template/configuration/template-env/). You
  can also run `yarn run config` in the root directory of the template,
  which will walk you through the setup process.

## Other optional changes

In addition to customizing the default styles and configuration options
of your custom developed marketplace, there are a number of other
changes you may want to make in code. Some of these options include:

- [Customize pricing](/tutorial/customize-pricing/)
- [Update your transaction process](/tutorial/create-transaction-process/)
- [Create new static pages](/template/content-management/how-to-add-static-pages/)
- [Update the routing in your marketplace](/template/routing/how-routing-works-in-template/)
- Update transaction email templates. For more information, see
  [Edit email templates with Sharetribe CLI](/how-to/emails-and-notifications/edit-email-templates-with-sharetribe-cli/)
  tutorial and [Email templates](/references/email-templates/) reference
  article.
