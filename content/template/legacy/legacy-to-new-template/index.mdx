# Moving your marketplace from a legacy template to Sharetribe Web Template

The Sharetribe product is built on top of the same technology that
powered our legacy product Flex. This means that if you want to update
your existing marketplace to use the new Sharetribe Web Template, you
can still keep using the same Console, and your marketplace data will
still be available.

However, you will need to make some changes to your data and environment
configurations before you move to the Sharetribe Web Template. This
article describes things you need to consider when planning this change.

## Check that you have the correct transaction processes in your environment

If you have created your marketplace environment prior to the 25th of
April 2023, it is good to note that there are four new transaction
processes the template uses, and those processes may not be in your
Sharetribe marketplace by default. You can find the transaction
processes in
[/ext/transaction-processes/](https://github.com/sharetribe/web-template/tree/main/ext/transaction-processes)
in the repository.

To use the template, you will need to have the transaction processes in
your Sharetribe environment.
[Follow these steps](/how-to/transaction-process/create-new-transaction-process-with-cli/)
to create both processes in your environment through Sharetribe CLI.

## Update your listing data

You can move from a legacy template based client app to a Sharetribe Web
Template based client and keep managing your existing listings in the
new application. To do so, you need to do the following things – first
in your Test or Dev environment, and finally in your Live environment.

Do not make changes to your Live data before testing those changes
thoroughly in either Test or Dev environments!

### Create your listing types and test listings in Console

In Console, create the listing types you want to have available on your
marketplace. Create a listing for each of the listing types with the
Sharetribe Web Template. You can connect a Sharetribe Web Template with
your existing environment by following these instructions:

- [Getting started with the Sharetribe Web Template](/introduction/getting-started-with-web-template/)

Then, review those new listings in Console and make a note of the values
for the three listed listing type related attributes:

- listingType
- transactionProcessAlias
- unitType

### Update your existing listings with the correct attributes

For each of your existing listings, edit the listing to add the three
attributes with the correct values according to the listing type you
want to assign to the listing.

You can create an Integration API script to update the attributes to
your listings

- if you only want to have a single listing type for all listings on
  your marketplace
- or if you have a way of programmatically determining which listing
  belongs to which listing type – for example if there is an attribute
  on your existing listings that always indicates the correct listing
  type

That way, you don't need to update all listings manually in Console.

We have an example script that you can use as the basis for this
development work.

- [Integration API example script: bulk update listings](https://github.com/sharetribe/integration-api-examples/blob/master/scripts/bulk-update-listings.js)

### Update other attributes on the marketplace

Once you've added the three necessary attributes to your listings, your
providers can then update other possible attributes (such as categories,
availability, price variations etc.) in the listing editing flow.

## Is it possible to combine a legacy custom code marketplace with the Sharetribe Web Template?

The Sharetribe Web Template has a lot of development work on top of the
legacy template versions. This means that even if it was technically
possible to take an upstream update to your legacy codebase, combining
your custom codebase and the Sharetribe Web Template codebase with a
merge would be slow and expensive.

If you do have custom developed features the Sharetribe Web Template
does not have that you want to keep in your marketplace, you will need
to implement those features on top of the Sharetribe Web Template
codebase. Depending on the feature, the effort required might range from
moderate to extensive.

On the server side, the differences between the legacy templates and
Sharetribe Web Template are not as extensive. This means that if your
feature code is mostly on the server side, you may be able to reuse
portions of your current code. Client-side changes will most likely
require a full rewrite.
