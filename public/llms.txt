# Sharetribe Developer Documentation

> Sharetribe is a headless marketplace solution for marketplace founders, offering a no-code builder and a developer platform to create online marketplaces.

- Sharetribe provides a managed backend which you can interact via with APIs, the Sharetribe CLI and Console.
- You can work with either the Sharetribe Web Template (a React-based marketplace template) or build your own custom frontend.
- You can manage your marketplace configurations via the Sharetribe Console. These configurations can be fetched via the Asset Delivery API.
- Working on your own custom client requires you to host it yourself.
